# Data Analytics Notebook: Analyzing "Alice in Wonderland"

This data analytics notebook explores the text of "Alice in Wonderland" to gain insights using Python libraries such as Beautiful Soup and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The text of "Alice in Wonderland" is available for free from Project Gutenberg at [https://www.gutenberg.org/](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

## Overview

In this notebook, I have performed various text analysis tasks on "Alice in Wonderland" using the NLTK library:

1. **Web Scraping**: I used Beautiful Soup to scrape the text of "Alice in Wonderland" from the Project Gutenberg website. The notebook demonstrates how to retrieve and preprocess the text for analysis.

2. **Tokenization**: I utilized NLTK's tokenization functions to break down the text into individual words and analyze their frequencies.

3. **Counting Common Words**: The notebook includes code to count the most common words in the text and visualize the results using graphical representations.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: I employed the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` pretrained model from NLTK to perform sentiment analysis on the text. The sentiment analysis provides insights into the overall sentiment of the book.
